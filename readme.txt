This is a template I use for most assignment types in subjects of Master of Biomedical Engineering, University of Melbourne.

This template is intended to be used in Overleaf.

This template is largely based on https://github.com/oaimli/ConfirmationReportTemplate.

To edit, just simply edit main.tex, and edit subsections/subsubsections according to your needs. Code blocks for images, equations and MATLAB codes are available as well.
